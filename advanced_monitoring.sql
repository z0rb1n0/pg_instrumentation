Implementation of os_proc_processes_io. Written as a function to bypass security restrictions.
basically the contents of /proc/<pid>/io, in a relational-friendly way. It returns usable info about postgresql backend processes only (due to /proc/<pid>/io permissions).
It uses numeric to prevent signed int overflow from unsigned long input :(
